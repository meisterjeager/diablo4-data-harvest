## About

Rust rewrite of [diablo4-string-parser](https://github.com/alkhdaniel/diablo-4-string-parser)

Currently only supports .stl files.

Drag a folder of .stl files over the binary.

Outputs string_list.json.

#
## UI

I've started adding a UI which will be used to view the data in a more organized way such as a tree view, search capabilities, and wasm support

You can still drag a folder over the binary
